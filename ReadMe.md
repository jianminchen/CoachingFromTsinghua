It is the first time I had a coach to help me to prepare most important onsite, and I like to get ideas how to think hard and deep on algorithm and data structure. 

Here is the blog after the end of coaching session: [say goodbye to my coach](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/06/say-goodbye-to-my-coach.html)

Here is the blog to document all the coaching session I got. [10 session of mock interviews](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/05/time-to-say-goodbye.html)

And also I like to check in all the source code into github. To use stack to find next large elment is my most favorite algorithm. I should have practiced more and read more on this monotonic increasing/ decreasing data structure, there are a few of cases to apply the technique. 

How I made a decision who to hire as my coach in May 2018? [Hire my coach](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/05/hire-and-develop-best.html), [hire the best](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/search?q=hire+the+best). <br>

There is a famous algorithm called Monte Carlo. I wrote a blog how to apply the algorithm to help life decision. [Monte carlo algorithm](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2017/09/monte-carlo-algorithm.html)

I documented detail in the following blog: [hire and develop best](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/05/hire-and-develop-best.html)

I got the advice to work on easy level algorithms on Leetcode.com. I should try to work on one easy level algorithm using 10 to 15 minutes. Try to complete 10 to 15 algorithms in one day. I solved **101 algorithms on Leetcode.com**.

Here is the blog I wrote to document 45 minutes coaching from my ex-coach.

I also documented the coaching compared to a two time Google intern I got after a mock interview. Here is the blog:

I just finished another 50 Leetcode algorithms, most of them are easy level. Here is the blog about the progress.

I celebrated 180 Leetcode algorithms problem solving here.

Sept. 23, 2018<br>
I celebrated **230 leetcode algorithms problem** solved here. <br>
[Say goodbye to string easy level algorithms](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/09/say-goodbye-to-easy-level-string.html)<br>

Oct. 1, 2018<br>
I completed **239 leetcode algorithms**. I am still working on easy level hashtable algorithms. I played Leetcode weekly contest 104 and worked on three algorithms. 

Oct. 9, 2018 <br>
Solved **252 algorithms**. I am working on Stack easy level algorithms. 

Nov. 13, 2018 <br>
Solved **300 algorithms**. I am working on middle level tree algorithms. 

Nov. 20, 2018 <br>
Solved **320 algorithms**. I am working on middle level tree algorithms. There are 8 medium level tree algorithms left for me to solve! I start to get comfortable to work on medium level tree algorithms. More patience, and think carefully about use cases. I can solve them one by one. 

March 26, 2019<br>
I made another practice on union-find algorithm and it was still too challenge for me to solve a problem in less than 60 minutes. I spent more than a few hours to warm up. <br> 

I solved 371/ 1011 algorithms. I like to spend more time to work on algorithm problem solving. <br> 

April 24, 2019<br>
I solved **392 algorithms** on Leetcode.com. <br>
I have to push myself hard to work on more algorithm practice. I could not pass online code assessment in March 2019, and then I had to prepare April 24, 2019 code assessment from Microsoft. <br>
I ran mock interview code screen with a real company until I ran out of all algorithms. I practiced a few of them, after that, I just spent less than five minutes to go over all problems, and then I go over the discussion panel to see the ideas how to solve the problems.

I spent $1000 Canadian dollar to pay using paypal. I should be more careful to spend money on coaching sessions. 

Oct. 17, 2019<br>
I solved 433 algorithms, 218 easy/ 167 medium/ 48 hard level algorithms. <br>
I had onsite interview with Amazon and Facebook in August 2019. <br>
I had phone screen with Docusign in Sept. 2019. <br>
I had onsite interview in the city of Burnaby with Fortinet in June 2019. <br>
