It is the first time I had a coach to help me to prepare most important onsite, and I like to get ideas how to think hard and deep on algorithm and data structure. 

Here is the blog after the end of coaching session: [say goodbye to my coach](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/06/say-goodbye-to-my-coach.html)

Here is the blog to document all the coaching session I got. [10 session of mock interviews](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/05/time-to-say-goodbye.html)

And also I like to check in all the source code into github. To use stack to find next large elment is my most favorite algorithm. I should have practiced more and read more on this monotonic increasing/ decreasing data structure, there are a few of cases to apply the technique. 

How I made a decision who to hire as my coach in May 2018? [hire the best](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/search?q=hire+the+best)

There is a famous algorithm called Monte Carlo. I wrote a blog how to apply the algorithm to help life decision. [Monte carlo algorithm](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2017/09/monte-carlo-algorithm.html)

I documented detail in the following blog: [hire and develop best](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/05/hire-and-develop-best.html)

I got the advice to work on easy level algorithms on Leetcode.com. I should try to work on one easy level algorithm using 10 to 15 minutes. Try to complete 10 to 15 algorithms in one day.

Here is the blog I wrote to document 45 minutes coaching from my ex-coach.

I also documented the coaching compared to a two time Google intern I got after a mock interview. Here is the blog:

I just finished another 50 Leetcode algorithms, most of them are easy level. Here is the blog about the progress.
