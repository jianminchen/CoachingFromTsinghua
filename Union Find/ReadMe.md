It is time for me to warm up the algorithm. I have to push myself to practice more often on the hard level algorithm. <br>

It is also important for me to relate to a concrete example and explain how the algorithm works. I have to continue to study and use this hard level algorithm to help me master the time complexity analysis.<br>

I did one more practice on March 26, 2019. Here is the folder to contain the source code.<br>
