It is the first time I had a coach to help me to prepare most important onsite, and I like to get ideas how to think hard and deep on algorithm and data structure. 

Here is the blog to document all the coaching session I got. http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/05/time-to-say-goodbye.html

And also I like to check in all the source code into github. To use stack to find next large elment is my most favorite algorithm. I should have practiced more and read more on this monotonic increasing/ decreasing data structure, there are a few of cases to apply the technique.
